# NOTES

# ELEMENTS OF EACH CARD
## NORMAL CARD:
* Background (landscape / setting)
* Symbol
* Number
* POSSIBLY some kind of figure? OR NOT.
* It's possible that we should have to tell a story by the conjunction of symbol, number, and landscape
* BUT we want some kind of IDENTITY, or SITUATION, or FOIBLE / PATHOS
## FACE CARD:
* Background (landscape / setting)
* LIMB-MONSTER (modular creature)
* Maybe every card has a randomly-generated CHARACTER:
* * head is symbol, torso with x number legs, arms and legs.
* * Each limb has a story with it, or some attributes, some verbs and nouns to draw from
* * We make a short phrase built from those limbs and the image chosen for each layer (BG too)
