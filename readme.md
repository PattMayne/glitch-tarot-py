# NOTES

# ELEMENTS OF EACH CARD
## NORMAL CARD:
* Background (landscape / setting)
* Symbol
* Number
* POSSIBLY some kind of figure? OR NOT.
* It's possible that we should have to tell a story by the conjunction of symbol, number, and landscape
* BUT we want some kind of IDENTITY, or SITUATION, or FOIBLE / PATHOS
## FACE CARD:
* Background (landscape / setting)
* LIMB-MONSTER (modular creature)
* Maybe every card has a randomly-generated CHARACTER:
* * head is symbol, torso with x number legs, arms and legs.
* * Each limb has a story with it, or some attributes, some verbs and nouns to draw from
* * We make a short phrase built from those limbs and the image chosen for each layer (BG too)
* **--NEW IDEA:**
* Normal numbered cards always have a FACE and ONLY a face. BUT...
* ... FACE cards actually have a whole MODULAR BODY
* They're still in a setting (BG card) and maybe the number is zero


## TO DO:
* send meta-data for alt description
* * name of symbol, BG, subject
* * number of symbols. Numbers of glitches.
* HTML template for "draw x cards" to mix in @ bottom of "draw" and top of "index"
* possibility of flipping left or right
* * maybe it's random
* arrange rows of symbols
* Different Patterns:
* * Dueling Corners

The **modular character** should be built like this:
* HEADS are NOT symbols: **HEADS** are modern-archetypal
* * TV-head-guy
* * meme guys
* BODIES are archetypal in other ways:
* * fat guy
* * skinny guy
* * fashion
* * robot body
* * tree or something
* then arms, legs, wheels, flippers

## TO START:
* enter the venv
* Install the packages in requirements.txt
*       flask --app app run
* Flask and Ajax can create a responsive front-end.
* * CSRF protection and sanitizing input

## SELECT IMAGES:
* **11 BACKGROUNDS**
* * Mars up close
* * Neptune
* * sky turning to space (or the moon)
* * Castle
* * Mountain
* * that image of titan? or venus?
* * city fancy buildings
